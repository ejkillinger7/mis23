                        <h2 class="section-heading">Hobbies</h2>
                        <p>Fishing: Fishing is one of my favorite hobbies when I need to relax or reset. I enjoy just being out on the water, regardless if I am actually catching fish...that is just a bonus. I enjoy fishing for Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass all over eastern Washignton. A few of my favorite lakes are Lake Roosevelt, Lake Spokane, and Horseshoe lake. </p>
                        <p>Golfing: Golfing is currently my hobby of choice. I grew up playing baseball which made the transition to hitting a golf ball difficult, however I have immproved a ton over the years. Golfing seems to be every ex-baseball players hobby of choice since you get to hit the ball far. A couple of my favorite courses in the Spokane area are Wandermere, Latah creek, and Qualchan.</p>
                        <p>Space: I have always been deeply fascinated by space and the mysteries that are still out there. I think there is so much to learn and we barely know a fraction of it. I also think space holds answers to some of the driving questions of humanity such as what our purpose is. Until just recently I planned on puruing a career in Astronomy, but changed my mind and looked forward to a carrer in business finance.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Family</h2>
                        <p>Family is the most important thing in my life and I was lucky enough to have been raised with and by the most amazing people I have ever known. I have a little brother who has always been by my side and is going to college next year and playing college baseball as a pitcher. I also have a girlfriend who I have dated for almost five years now and we just recelty got a white golden retriver puppy and named him McFly. I also have a big St. Bernard named Doc. My family is very close and we are all lucky to be so important in eachothers lives.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Favorite Sports Teams</h2>
                        <p>Seahawks: My most loved sports franchise that puts me through a ridiculous amount of eotional rollercoasters. We have season tickets and are looking forward to this teams future and watchign them grow.</p>
                    
                        <p>Mariners: I love baseball, especially being a college baseball player. I am excieted for their future as well and would love to catch some games this summer.</p>
                        <p>Gonzaga basketball: The most close-to-home team I have ever watched on a consistent basis. They are so good every year so they are fun to watch. However, it is annoying they have never won a NCAA championship with the amount of talent that has came through the school.</p>
